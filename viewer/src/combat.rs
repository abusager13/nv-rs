//! The player fighting (`world::combat`): with the weapon in hand (the
//! one equipped, else the first carried) or fists, the left mouse button
//! attacks along the view: guns as far as their projectile's range, each
//! pellet within the weapon's cone (its min spread, as the game fires
//! them), melee weapons and fists as far as their reach (× 128; 64
//! unarmed) between the bodies' edges. What's hit first takes it: a person
//! or creature, a scripted object (its `OnHit` blocks run), or a wall,
//! which stops it. Guns fire at their attack rate, use their ammunition
//! from the inventory, and need reloading (R) after a clip. Whoever is
//! hurt fights back (`ai`). A line at the bottom shows health, ammunition
//! and the player's crippled limbs.
//!
//! Where a hit lands (`world::body_parts`): shots must meet one of the
//! capsules the target's skeleton carries on its bones (the game's own hit
//! shapes: its ragdoll's bodies, posed as the actor is now), and land on
//! that bone's part; a melee hit reaches the target by its body's bounds
//! and lands where the view meets a capsule, else on the bone nearest the
//! view (a guess). Skeletons without bodies use their record's bounds and
//! the nearest bone. A person who drops their weapon has its model hidden.
//!
//! Grenades and thrown weapons (dynamite) are thrown instead: their
//! projectiles fly and explode in `explosives`.
//!
//! Not yet: other projectiles in flight (the game's bullets are hitscan;
//! missiles, flames and beams fly), auto-aim (3° toward a target), the
//! gun sway's turn on shots (`world::gun_wobble`), hits on a held weapon
//! outside V.A.T.S. (part 14: its collision isn't tested). V.A.T.S. is
//! `vats`, which shoots through [`first_met`] too.
